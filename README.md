Palm Pilot Bluetooth and IR interface proxy between Lego Mindstorms and client app

NOTE: This was done back in 2005 as part of our final school assignment. This is the server part, there is also a client part for a cell phone coded in Java. The complete application was used to steer and command a Lego Mindstorms car via a cell phone's Bluetooth to a Palm Pilot on the Lego car, that in turn translated the commands into IR commands that was transmitted to the Mindstorms engine on the car. I.e. you could drive the car with your phone, command its pneumatics and lights and so on.

I (Johan Runsten) authored the server program and Niklas Bivald authored the client.
